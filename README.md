# AlgorithmsFromTheBook
This is a project that takes all of the theoretical concepts from Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Eva Tardos and puts them into practice. The goal was to improve my C++ skills, as well as to be able to write and understand more complex algorithms. It is written as a header only library because many of the functions and data structures are templated, and templates don't play well with .cpp files.

##Getting Started
TODO: download on a different computer and figure out how to get started

###Prerequisites
TODO: figure out if boost needs to be downloaded or if it is packaged in there with it

##Running the tests
TODO: show examples of tests and write how they help people
(they show what the expected output is for each algo, and show some examples)

##Built with
Miscoroft Visual Studio 2015 C/C++ Compiler
